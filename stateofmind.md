Hypnosis has long been construed as an altered state of consicousness. However, years of research have proven that people can experience and respond to suggestions in an appropriate context without any trance induction aimed at altering state of consciousness. This however, doesn't imply states of mind are entirely to be discounted. A person in a motivated, engaged, expectant state of mind may respond differently to a skeptical, demotivated, disengaged state. Furthermore, certain states may be more conducive to certain phenomena. For example, in the Phenomenological Control Scale paper, they contrast two initial processes and their effects on the same set of scale items. In the condition labeled "hypnosis", a relaxation induction is used and response measured by SWASH and in the other condition, a guided imagination process is used where the participant imagines stepping down a set of stairs, no mention of relaxation or hypnosis is made. Interestingly, Subjects in the hypnosis condition performed worse than the hypnosis-free condition, particularly on the motor items under consideration. The authors explain this as the subjects' predisposition against hypnosis lead to them not responding as well but given the induction of relaxation at the start, motor movements and muscular tension based items being impaired might be expected.

Especially, if we continue to think in the framework of responding to suggestions as skills, it is evident that certain states of mind and mental states are more conducive to certain skills. Compare the relaxed focus needed for shooting to the hightened arousal needed for powerlifting. With PSTP, we will largely focus on three kinds of mental states, states of emotion/the affective state, states of expectation and states of engagement in order to enhance response in general. We can reason along these lines with Adam Eason's Hypnotic Mindset that invites Subjects to have:

* Motivation: You need to be motivated to engage in hypnosis or self-hypnosis.
* Confidence: You should have confidence in your ability to respond to hypnosis.
* Optimism: Maintaining an optimistic attitude about the hypnosis process is important.
* Expectation: You should expect to automatically experience the responses being suggested or imagined.
* Engagement: Deeply engaging with the role of being hypnotized is part of the mindset.

Which can be concieved of both as a set of attitudes or mental states.

Furthermore, states of mind and consciousness are responsive to suggestion. Suggestions with regard to affect work though very few scales have any items that capture this response, Creative Imagination Scale being an exception with its "Mind-Body Relaxation" item. The hypnotic literature has mostly been blinkered to change in state beyond sleep inductions, and looking for a "special state" or "depth" (or trying to disprove those concepts). However, we can refer to other literatures besides hypnosis in order to understand the ability to affect state change unhindered by the historical baggage of hypnotic state. An interesting [taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834522/) of meditation practices posits three main kinds of states:

* Enhanced Cognitive State (Focus, Flow, Open Awareness, etc)
* Enchanced Affective State (Metta/loving-kindness, lower jhanas)
* Null State (Dissociation, blank, higher jhanas)

We see these states pop up in recreational hypnosis spaces as a part of trance inductions, in addition, we also see states that have more of a cognitive looseness to them, and closer to the state of mind wandering and hypnagogic states. Furthermore, there are headspaces and states that relate to a change in one's identity and are more related to role enactment, acting and possession trances of old.

Understanding the alterations in the affective state can be guided by Mood and [Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAD_emotional_state_model).

While the Dynamic Framework of Thought can begin to give us an inkling for the Cognitive and Null States:
