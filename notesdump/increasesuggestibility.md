Based on the research summarized in these papers, there are a few key strategies that have been shown to increase hypnotic suggestibility:

The Carleton Skills Training Program (CSTP): This is one of the most well-studied approaches, developed by Spanos and colleagues. It includes:


Providing information to correct misconceptions about hypnosis
Role modeling by suggestible subjects
Teaching subjects to use imagery and imagination
Instructing subjects on how to actively interpret and respond to suggestions
Practicing responding to suggestions with feedback


Building rapport: Studies found that when trainers actively tried to build rapport with subjects, suggestibility increases were enhanced.
Creating positive attitudes and expectations: Providing information to create positive attitudes about hypnosis and expectations of increased ability seems to boost responsiveness.
Imagery practice: Encouraging subjects to vividly imagine suggested effects appears to increase suggestibility.
Framing responses as active and voluntary: Teaching subjects to view hypnotic responses as something they actively create, rather than passively experience, increases suggestibility.
Repeated practice: Multiple training/practice sessions tend to produce larger gains than single sessions.
Contextual factors: The overall experimental context, including the perceived professionalism and authority of the setting, can influence suggestibility increases.
Relaxation and focused attention: Some approaches incorporate relaxation techniques and exercises to focus attention.

However, a key debate is whether these strategies produce genuine increases in hypnotic ability vs. simply increasing compliance and willingness to respond. Follow-up studies show gains often diminish over time. Many researchers argue the effects are largely due to changed attitudes, expectations and interpretations rather than fundamental changes in hypnotic capacity.
