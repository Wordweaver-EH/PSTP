According to a [biopsychosocial perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220267/), five psychosocial factors stand out in the literature as affecting response:
* Context
* Rapport
* Expectation
* Absorption
* Motivation

These can be abbreviated to [CREAM](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/18ret6y/context_rapport_expectation_absorption_and/) and further synthesized into 3Es:

* Emotion (Motivation+Rapport)
* Expectation (Context+Expectation)
* Engagement (Absorption+Rapport)

The demand characteristics of the context here are folded into expectations, and rapport is split into two components, the first is affective regard between the dyad and the second is synchrony between the two. 
These three factors also are key factors in theories of narrative and associative learning. While much of the CREAM factors are already set before the induction begins in a traditional hypnosis scenario, the 3Es can help impart narrative stimulus after the process has started.
Expectation is thought to be one of the key determining factors behind "hypnotic" response. 
While engagement and coaching a person to engage in a particular way keeps them engaged in the process that allows responses to manifest. 
Task motivational instructions, trance inductions, guided imagination scenarios are aimed in the current framework proposed here to ensure engagement and coach engagement and invite the participant in a particular [state of mind]() conducive to response.
Emotion has been hypothesized by Kev Sheldrake and Anthony Jacquin to increase response by inhibiting accurate higher order thoughts. People are less likely to think critically and "reality test" when swept away by congruent emotions that help them suspend disbelief.
Emotion also functions as a marker for salience and increases associative strengths between stimulus and response.
