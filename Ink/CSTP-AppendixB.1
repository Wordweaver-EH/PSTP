APPENDIX B
Audio Training Information

Remember how in old movies the hypnotist would have the
subject fixate on a dangling pocketwatch? As the subject
followed the watch with his or her eyes, the hypnotist would
suggest repeatedly in a low voice something like: "You are
becoming sleepy; your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier
and are closing, closing completely; you want to go sleep; you
are falling into a deep, deep sleep". In one form or another,
these instructions are still presented by hypnotists to their
subjects today. You may recall that in your last session in
this lab, you were presented with these kinds of instructions,
albeit without the watch. You were repeatedly told by the
voice on the tape recorder that you were falling into a deep
sleep.

It was once commonly believed that giving subjects
repeated instructions to go to sleep would cause them to go
into a hypnotic trance. When in this trance, the subject was
believed to come under the direct control of the hypnotist.
The hypnotist was believed to take over the hypnotized
subject's mind and body to do practically anything. The
subject was thus viewed as an automaton or robot, who was
fully subject to the commands of the hypnotist. This view of
hypnosis is one of the great misconceptions in the history of

psychology. Subjects in a hypnotic session are, in fact,

fully awake and are in full control of all their actions. The

69

repeated instructions for sleep do not cause you to go into a
“trance” in which you "lose control of your actions" and
become a "robot". No such hocus pocus is involved in
hypnosis. Hypnosis has nothing whatsoever to do with any loss
of consciousness, trances, or a loss of control. Far from
involving a loss of control, hypnosis actually involves a
skill that is within the full control of the individual. It
is a skill that anyone can learn and master, if given proper
instructions and enough practice. In this sense, it is no
different than learning the skills required to ride a bicycle,
to swim, or to solve mathematical problems. The repeated
instructions for sleep simply serve the purpose of enabling
you to relax and put your mind on learning the hypnotic skill.
Few people are ever taught the hypnotic skill, and as a
consequence, few people are able to produce hyupnotic
responses. Asking the subject who is never learned the
hypnotic skill to respond hypnotically is similar to asking a
person who has never learned to swim, to swim the length of a
pool. Clearly, the non-swimmer has first to learn how to swim
before being able to swim the length of the pool. Similarly,
the subject who has never learned the hypnotic skill has first
to learn this skill before being able to produce hypnotic
responses.
In order to enable you to learn the hypnotic skill, I am
going to show you exactly what this skill involves and then

give you plenty of opportunity to practice it. Learning the
70
hypnotic skill is fully within the capabilities of normal
individuals provided they know just what is is that they must
do. In fact, research shows that any well-adjusted person of
your age is fully able to learn the hypnotic skill provided he
or she puts forth sufficient effort. As in learning any new
skill, learning this skill is completely within your control
and is quite rewarding to master. In addition, individuals
who learn the hypnotic skill find it a very insteresting
experience.

What the hypnotic skill involves is that you make belive
something. Before I describe this skill in more detail, let
me give you an example. You are probably familiar with the
Charlie Brown comic strip. In it, Charlie Brown's dog,
Sncopy, is often pictured sitting on his doghouse wearing a
helmet and a scarf, paws outstretched, and gritting his teeth.
Snoopy gets deeply involved in a make-believe situation. He
imagines himself to be in a situation in which he is a World
War I flying ace in the air somewhere over Germany, in hot
pursuit of the Red Baron. He gets so involved in his make-
believe actions that, for the moment, he acutally believes
he's flying an airplane somewhere over Germany. He simply
forgets that he's really a dog on a doghouse. It's plain to
see that Snoopy is in total control of his actions.

Let us more carefully analyze what Snoopy is doing.
First off, he himself creates an entire make-believe

situation. He does this through the direct control of his

71
imagination. He actively imagines such things as the clouds
around him, his own airplane and that of the Red Baron's, the
roar of the engines, and everything else that is part of such
a situation. In short, through his imagination, in which he
is in direct control, he creates an entire make-believe
situation.

However, it is important to understand that the hypnotic
skill involves more than simply imagining a particular
situation. A further analysis of the Snoopy example will
illustrate what I mean. Snoopy did something more than simply
create a new situation. He went one step further and actually
became a part of that situation. He completely replaced the
situation he was in formerly with a new one. he let the
“World War I" situation completely replace the one in which he
was merely “a dog on a doghouse". This had the interesting
effect of making the “World War I" situation seem real,
because it was the only one to which Snoopy was directing his
attention. According to modern psychology's definition of
hypnosis, Snoopy was hypnotized because he was so preoccupied
with his imaginings of the make-believe that he forgot they
were make-believe.

This skill is therefore not unusual nor mysterious. It's
a rather common occurrence and what is meant when someone is
said to be "absorbed", or "deeply involved", or “really into"
their thoughts and imaginings. This skill is, of course,

totally within your control, for you can initiate or terminate
72
it whenever you like. To further illustrate the degree of
control you have in hypnosis, think of what young children are
like when they play. Needless to say, they quite readily get
involved in the make-believe. Nonetheless, even children
possess the ability to shift from the real to the imaginary
world and back again whenever they like. For instance, when
mother beckons that supper is ready, a child easily shifts his
or her attention from the make-believe world to the real world
goal of satisfying his or her hunger.

It's worth noting that we never lose our skill at
becoming deeply involved in our imaginings of make-believe.
For one reason or another, however, we simply do not do it as
much as children do. At any rate, you will no doubt be
surprised at how good you are at this skill. Our research
suggests that you will get better and better at it the more
you get a chance to practice.

Now, what are you going to make-belive? You will not be
asked to do things as extreme or as potentially embarrassing
as being a World War I flying ace or a famous movie star.
Instead, you will be asked to involve yourself in some simple
make-believe actions of a non-embarrassing kind. Soon you
will be presented with some suggestions, four in all, not much
different from the ones you were presented with the last time
you were in the lab. It is these suggestions that will
provide you with the make-believe situation what you will

involve yourself in.

73

The first suggestion you will be presented is an arm
rising suggestion. It will inform you of exactly what it is
you are to make believe. It will specifically tell you that
your arm is like a hollow balloon being pumped up with heliun,
and that the helium being pumped in makes your arm so light
that it rises into the air by itself. In response to this
suggestion, you must do everything that is required of someone
making believe such a thing, you must lift your arm up, and
you must imagine that the helium, and anything else you wish
to imagine that is consistent with such a make-believe
situation.

Of course your arm will not really go up by itself. You
must raise it. However, you can make it feel like it is going
up by itself by focusing on the make-believe situation that
your arm is hollow and being filled with helium. As long as
you focus in and elaborate on this make-believe situation and
do not let yourself think about other things, the arm will
feel like it is going up by itself. You must become very
deeply involved in the make-believe and actually make it seem
real. Becoming involved requires that you keep your attention
only on the things the suggestion tells you to imagine. You
must rivet your attention on the hollow arm, its lightness,
the fact that it's going up by itself, and so on. Don't
imagine or pay attention to anything that is unrelated to the
make-believe situation. Attending strongly to imaginings of

the make-believe situation only, will help prevent the
74
possibility of irrelevant thoughts entering your mind and
shaking you out of the make-believe world.
