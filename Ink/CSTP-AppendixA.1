APPENDIX A

Modification Instructions

You have been chosen for this study because you have
shown low susceptibility in a previous hypnosis session. We
elieve that people show low responsiveness to suggestions
because they are not quite sure how they should be thinking or
acting in response to suggestions. Research has shown that
instruction and practice can significantly increase an
individual's responsiveness. So today's session is a
practice/training session.

The procedure is this: First you will hear a lengthy
introduction to hypnosis. It will outline some of the myths
and misconceptions of hypnosis. For example, hypnosis is not
a trance state, there is no loss of control, no loss of
consciousness. The person responding to suggestions is in
complete control, very aware of his/her mind and body. In
fact, the person who is responding hypnotically is probably
more aware and more in control of directing his or her mind
than at any other time during the day. The sleep suggestion
in the “induction” is there to help people become calm and
relaxed in order that they may concentrate, (May be some
discussion on any of these myths, according to the subject).

Following the taped introduction to hypnosis, you will
hear an introduction to the first suggestion. There will be
four suggestions presented in all. After each one is

introduced, you will vew a videotape of a subject responding
55
to the suggestion. She has practised the skill which you are

going to learn today. You will notice that this tape is not
of a spontaneous session such as this one. Rather, it is a
condensed presentation of many points which we wanted to
communicate to you.

The subject on the videotape will be verbalizing her
responses throughout the session so that you will know what
kinds of things she is thinking about. You will not be
expected to do this. Following this, you will see a short
interview during which the major points will be clarified.
Pay close attention to these points.

Then you will have an opportunity to practice responding
to the suggestion yourself. In this way, we will work with
four suggestions together, using the videotape as a model. At
the very end of the session, after you have practised the four
suggestions, you will be given four different suggestions
which will be presented one after the other. You will respond
to this series without any instructions or coaching. This is
your opportunity to demonstrate whatever skills you have
acquired during the session in a spontaneous manner. Do you

have any questions about the procedure?
