Before you are given an opportunity to respond to this
suggestion, you will be shown a videotape of another subject
responding to it. When this subject's responses were taped,
she had already gone through a good deal of practice at
responding to this suggestion and several others. I am
presenting you her responses to give you a clearer idea on how
properly to respond to this suggestion. When I roll the tape,
you will observe that the subject verbalizes many of her
thoughts aloud. She was asked to do this as a means of
illustrating to viewers, such as yourself, that all of her
thoughts and imaginings during the suggestion are on the make-
believe situation, and on nothing else. (PLAY VIDEOTAPE OF

Arm Rising Suggestion

Close your eyes. Place your right arm straight out in
front of you at shoulder height. (PAUSE) Imagine that your
right arm is light and hollow, like a balloon, and that it is
gradually being pumped up with helium. The helium is lighter
than air and it is causing your hollow arm to become lighter
and lighter and to rise in the air. It's slowly rising into
the air. More and more helium is being pumped into your arn,
and the arm is getting lighter and lighter and just continues

to rise. (WAIT 25 SECONDS) Relax your arm now and place it on
75
the table and continue tio relax.

The next suggestion to be presented is the hand~lock
suggestion. It will tell you just what you are to make
believe. It will initially tell you to fold your hands. Then
it will tell you to imagine that your hands are really two
hunks of steel that are welded together. Following this, the
suggestion will challenge you to pull the hands apart.
Despite this challenge, don't pull the hands apart. Instead,
make believe that the hands are so tightly welded together
that despite your best efforts, you simply cannot get them
apart.

Remember what the hypnotic skill involves. You must let
yourself become so deeply involved in the make-believe that it
actually seems real. Do this by only imagining and thinking
things that are connected with the make-believe situation.

Now, observe the subject responding to the hand-lock
suggestion. As she is being presented with the suggestion,
she will carry out all the suggested actions and, in addition,
she will verbalize aloud the appropriate kinds of thoughts and
imaginings one should have during this suggestion. (PLAY

Hand-lock Suggestion

Close your eyes. Place your hands on the table, and
clasp them together, interlacing the fingers. (PAUSE)

Imagine that your hands are two pieces of steel that are
76
welded together so that it is impossible to get them apart.
They are two pieces of steel welded together. When I ask you
to pull your hands apart, they will be stuck and will not come
apart no matter how hard you try. Okay, try to pull them
apart. (WAIT 25 SECONDS) Okay, now relax, the suggestion is
over, your hands can come apart again.

The next suggestion will tell you that you see a book on
the desk in front of you even though there is really no book
there. The suggestion will start out by telling you to close
your eyes; and will tell you that the book is on the desk in
front of you. It will suggest that you see the book once you
open your eyes. The suggestion will then instruct you to open
your eyes and actually see the book. In response to this
suggestion, you are to make yourself see the book and, in
addition, you are to make believe that the book you are seeing
is physically there and part of the natural setting of the
room, and not simply something you are artificially making
appear. The main idea idea then, is to make the book you see
seem like a natural part of the room. Just let yourself
become totally involved in making believe that the book is
really there.

There is another thing. Towards the end of the
suggestion you will be asked to push the book off to the side.
This action is also part of the make-believe. Even as you do
it, continue to make believe there is really a book there.

Now, observe the actions of the subject on the videotape

77
when she is presented with the suggestion to see the book. As
before, she will verbalize aloud the appropriate kinds of
imaginings and thoughts one should have when acting in
response to this suggestion. Pay careful attention. (PLAY

Book Hallucination Suggestion

Place your hands on your lap and close your eyes.
(PAUSE) I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there is a book
of mine on the desk in front of you. It is an average-sized
book, one like hundreds you've seen. It is right there in
front of you on the desk. Open your eyes and look at the book
sitting there on the desk. (WAIT 20 SECONDS) To avoid the
book being in your way, why don't you just slide it off to the
Side. (WAIT 20 SECONDS) The image of the book is now fading.
It has faded completely and you can no longer see the book.

The next suggestion is one that will tell you that you
are forgetting something youâ€™ know. Specifically, the
suggestion will state that the memories of the suggestions you
were presented eariier in this session are fading completely
from your mind. The suggestions I am referring to are, of
course, are the arm-rising suggestion, the  hand-lock
suggestion, and the suggestion to see the book. In response
to the suggestion to forget, you are to make yourself forget
the other suggestions. Do this by concentrating deeply on

something other than the memories, thereby distracting
78
yourself from them. By distracting yourself in this manner,
you will be unable to remember the suggestions.

The suggestion to forget also requires that you make
believe that the suggestions are actually fading from your
memory all by themselves and that you are doing nothing to
make them go away. Therefore, you are to make believe that
your forgetting is something that just happens to you, not
something that you are causing.

As usual, you are to become deeply involved in this make-
believe. Only attend to the make-believe situation; namely,
that your memories of the suggestion are just fading away by
themselves.

There is another matter. At one point in the suggestion,
you will be challenged to remember the suggestions and write
them down on a piece of paper. Despite this chalienge, you
are to continue to distract yourself from the suggestions
while making believe you really cannot remember them. The
challenge is all part of the make-believe situation. It is
meant to further establish the fact that, despite your best
efforts tc remember the suggestions, you simply cannot;
they're gone.

To summarize, your task is to become so deeply involved
in the make-believe that you son't notice that it's really you
who is preventing the recall of the memories.

Following the challenge to remember the suggestions,

there will be a one-minute pause in which you will be able to
79
write down any of the suggestions that you remember. This, in
turn, will be followed by the cancellation of the forgetting,
that is, the voice will say that you can remember the
suggestions again. Once this is done, you will be asked again
to write the suggestions down on another piece of paper that
will be provided. It will be all right, at this point to stop
distracting yourself, stop making believe, and actually write
down the names of the suggestions on the paper.

Now, observe the subject on the videotape respond to this
one. As she is presented with the suggestion, she will again
verbalize her thoughts. Notice that her thoughts and
imaginings are on things other than the memories of the
suggestions. Notice also that she continues to distract
herself even when she is provided with the challenge to try to
remember the suggestions. The important thing to grasp here
is that she directs her attention to other things, yet never
admits or event thinks that what she is doing is in any way
connected with forgetting the suggesticns. By doing this, she
can do all the suggestion requires; she can forget the
suggestions presented earlier, and she can simultaneously muke
believe that she has done nothing to make the suggestions go
away. Attend carefully to what she does. (PLAY VIDEOTAPE OF

Amnesia Suggestion

Close your eyes. As you recall, you were given three
80
suggestions. However, a funny thing is beginning to happen.
The memory of these suggestions is fading, fading completely.
In fact, you are totally unable to remember what these
suggestions were. Nevertheless, I want you to try to remember
them - even though this will be impossible. Open your eyes
and write down the suggestions that you can rembmer on the
sheet of paper on the desk. You will be given one minute to
do so. Begin (WAIT ONE MINUTE) Time is up.

Now the memories are returning. They are becoming more
and more clear. In fact, you can remember all the suggestions
that were presented. Write down all of the suggestions on the
paper provided. Again, you will have one minute. (WAIT ONE

MINUTE) Time is up.

Instruction for Test Suggestions

In a moment, you will be presented with four more
suggestions that are different from the ones you've just been
presented. In addition, the upcoming suggestions will be
presented one after the other with only sufficient time in
between for you to make a full response. That is, you will be
presented with a suggestion, given ample opportunity to
respond to it, and then be presented with the next suggestion
right afterwards, and so on.

You will not be given the extensive instructions you were
given before. You will not, for instance, be told what an

upcoming suggestion is, nor will you be given any instructions

81
on how exactly to respond to such a suggestion. The reason
why I am taking these measures is because you already know how
to go about responding hypnotically, so going over the
instructions again will probably be dull and boring for you.
There is another even more important reason. Sugaestions
presented in this manner will require that you apply the
skills you've learnec to new tasks. As a good hypnotic
subject, you must be able to respond hypnotically to any
sugestion you are presented, even if you have not received it
before or have not been given instructions on how to respond
to it. With the basic skills you have now learned and with a
little effort and creativity on your part, you will no doubt
be able to respond hypnotically to any new suggestions that
you are presented.

Now, close your eyes and take half a minute to mentally
rehearse the hypnotic skill and really get yourself psyched-up
to respond hypnotically to each of the four new suggestions to
be presented. I'll present the suggestions beginning in 30
seconds. (AFTER 30 SECONDS, THE TEST SUGGESTIONS ARE

PRESENTED)

Arms Apart

Close your eyes. Place both of your hands straight out
in front of you at shoulder height, with the paims facing one
another and with the fingertips of one hand touching the

fingertips of the other. Imagine that a force is beginning to
82

make the hands repel one another. The force is getting
stronger and stronger. It's getting so strong that it is
beginning to push your hands apart. It's getting stronger and
stronger and your hands are moving further and further apart.
(WAIT 20 SECONDS)

The force is no longer active. Place your hands back on

the table. Continue to relax.

Hearing a Voice

You are taking a course in the history of psychology and
you are now in the classroom. In a moment, the professor will
ask in what country Sigmund Freud was born. Of course, you
know from your studies that is was Moravia. As you can hear,
the professor is already asking several other questions about
Freud, and he is just getting to the country of birth
question, so get ready. In a few seconds, I want you to hear
the professor ask Freud's birthplace and raise your hand to
answer the question. (WAIT 20 SECONDS) Okay, he's calling on
someone else. You can lower your hand. Perhaps he'll call on
you in tomorrow's class. Keep your eyes closed and continue

to relax.

Head Lowering Suggestion

Now, imagine that a force is pushing down on the top of

your head, causing it to feel heavy. It feels like someone

has plaaced the palm of their hand on the top of your head and

83

is pushing downward. Your head is being pushed down with such
force that your chin is moving toward your chest. The force
continues to push, making your head feel heavier and heavier,
making it fall forward more and more. (WAIT 20 SECONDS) The
hand is no longer pushing on your head and you can sit up

again and relax. Continue to relax.

nesia

As you recall, you were just given three suggestions.
However, a funny thing is beginning to happen: The memory of
these suggestions is fading, fading completely. In fact, you
are totally unable to remember what these suggestions were.
Nevertheless, I want you to try to remember them, even though
this will be impossible. Open your eyes and write down the
suggestions on the sheet of paper on the desk. You will be
given one minute. Begin. (WAIT ONE MINUTE) Time is up.

Now the memories are returning. They are becoming more
and more clear. In fact, you can remember all the suggestions
that were presented. Write down all of the suggestions on the
paper provided. Again, you will have one minute. (WAIT ONE

MINUTE) Time is up.
