EXPERIMENTER ROLLS THE AUDIOTAPE UNTIL THE LAST LINE OF THE
ARM RISING SUGGESTION: "Here is the subject responding to the

arm rising suggestion." THEN STOP THE AUDIOTAPE AND TURN ON
56
THE VIDEO TO PLAY THE RESPONSE AND THE INTERVIEW FOR THIS

SUGGESTION.

Discussion with Subject

You will notice that there are two parts involved in
responding to any suggestion: the physical and the mental.
For example, for the arm rising suggestion, the subject must
physically raise her arm. Some “thing” does not come along
and raise it for her. However, it feels like it's going up by
itself because of the mental imaginings.

You must concentrate on a mental image which is
consistent with the suggestion, such as imagining that your
arm is being pumped up with helium or whatever. Some people
find that imagining balloons attached to their arm is a good
image to work with. Others find that they can involve
themselves in the suggestion with an image of a pulley slowly
pulling their arm up. Others relate to that sensation you get
when you are in the water and your arm floats upwards. Pick
a mental image that you can relate to. One that you can work
with. If you start with one type of mental imagining and find
you cannot focus on it for the full length of the suggestion,
feel free to incoroporate another imagining.

The subject, you will notice, did not limit herself to
the details provided by the suggestion. She elaborated upon
the suggestion by thinking about the hose leading to the pump
and the details of the pump itself. She mentions that she did
57
not let criticisms or comments about what she was doing,
arise. The mind can only attend to one thing at a time, and
she kept it concentrated on the experience of the suggestion.
Any inner verbalization must be in keeping with the
suggestion. “It's light", etc., not "this is dumb" or “it's
heavy.

Feedback betweeen these mental and physical aspects
reinforce each other. the physical movement of the arm rising
reinforces the mental image which, in turn, reinforces the
physical movement. The result is that there is a feeling of
lightness and the feeling that it is going up by itself. You
must make it feel as if it is going up by itself.

HELPFUL HINTS IF THE SUBJECT HAS TROUBLE

You will notice that as you take a deep inhalation your
upper body moves. Try, if you are having trouble with
beginning the physical movement, raising your arm with each
breath, letting it rest on the exhalation and raising it more
on the next inhalation. Deep breathing and relaxation are
appropriate to a suggestion which involves lightness. Use a
mental image that is familiar to you. Keep the arm loose, not
tight or clenched. Otherwise, the feedback is of heaviness,
etc. . So pick an image to work with. I'll play the
suggestion and you try it, using the things you just seen and

we have talked about. Sit back and close your eyes.
