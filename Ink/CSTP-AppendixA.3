THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE TAPE OF THE ARM RISING SUGGESTION.
UNOBSTRUSIVELY, THE EXPERIMENTER SCORES THE SUBJECT ON THE
OBJECTIVE MEASURE. IF THE SUBJECT RAISES HIS/HER ARM MORE
THAN SIX INCHES, THE SUBJECT PASSES THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF
THE ITEM AND RECEIVES A "1". IF THE SUBJECT DOES NOT RAISE
HIS/HER ARM MORE THAN SIX INCHES, THE SUBJECT FAILS THE
OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF THE SUGGESTION, WILL GET A “0O“ AND WILL
HAVE TO TRY IT AGAIN. AS SOON AS THE SUGGESTION IS OVER, THE
EXPERIMENTER GIVES THE SUBJECT THE TWO-PAGE, TWO-QUESTION
SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE ITEMS. NO TALKING WITH THE SUBJECT
UNTIL THESE QUESTION HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. SCORING ON THE

SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONS IS AS FOLLOWS:

THE SUBJECT MUST RESPOND TO BOTH QUESTIONS WITH A (c) OR (da)
IN ORDER TO PASS THE SUBJECTIVE ITEMS. IN ORDER FOR THE
SUBJECT TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SUGGESTION, HE/SHE MUST HAVE
PASSED THE QBJECTIVE ITEMS AS WELL AS BOTH SUBJECTIVE
QUESTIONS. A “O" ON THE OBJECTIVE WITH PASSES ON THE
SUBJECTIVE DOES NOT ALLOW THE SUBJECT TO MOVE ON. CONVERSELY,
A PASS ON EITHER OR BOTH SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONS DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE AN OVERALL PASS ON THE SUGGESTION UNLESS THE
OBJECTIVE SCORES IS A "1". THIS SCORING PROCEDURE IS USED FOR
EACH SUGGESTION DURING THE SESSION. THE SUBJECT MAY REPEAT
EACH SUGGESTION ONLY ONCE.

IF THE SUBJECT MUST REPEAT THE SUGGESTION, THE EXPERIMENTER

59
REINFORCES ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THE SUBJECT'S RESPONSE.

ASK WHAT MENTAL IMAGE THE SUBJECT USED AND PERHAPS SUGGEST AN
ELABORATION OR A DIFFERENT ONE. REITERATE THE MAJOR POINTS OF
THE RESPONSE AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE CLEAR TO THE SUBJECT.
EMPHASIZE STRONG CONCENTRATION AND INVOLVEMENT. CHECK
VERBALIZATION FOR JUDGEMENTS OR CRITICISMS DURING THE
REPSONSE. PERHAPS THE SUBJECT IS TRYING TOO HARD OR IS TOO
RIGID. SOMETIMES, TOO MUCH EFFORT SERVES ONLY TO REMIND THE
SUBJECT THAT THEY ARE UTILIZING SOME STRATEGIES AND THEREFORE

DOES NOT ALLOW THAT SENSE OF “INVOLUNTARINESS" TO DEVELOP.

IF THE SUBJECT MUST REPEAT THE SUGGESTION, ROLL THE SECOND
TAPE (WHICH ONLY HAS THE PRACTICE SUGGESTION ON IT). SCORING
PROCEDURE IS THE SAME AS ABOVE. THE SUBJECT GOES ON TO THE
SECOND SUGGESTION REGARDLESS OF THE SCORE. IF THE SUBJECT DID
NOT IMPROVE, TELL THEM IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE AS IT GOES
AGAINST GRAVITY, AND THAT MOST PEOPLE FIND THE NEXT SUGGESTION
MUCH EASTER.

and u

ROLL THE AUDIOTAPE UNTIL THE VOICE SAYS: “She will verbalize
aloud the appropriate kind of thoughts and imaginings one
should have during the suggestion". THEN PLAY THE VIDEO OF

THE SUBJECT RESPONDING AND THE INTERVIEW.

Discussion with the subject

This suggestion is easier for a lot of subjects because
it is easier to enter into the physical part of the
suggestion. As you were told con the tape, the challenge to
try to pull your hands apart is part of the suggestion. By
the time you are asked to try to pull your hands apart, you
should be so involved in your imagining, it will feel as if
you really cannot pull them apart.

Also, as you were told for the first suggestion, you are
not limited to using the image given in the suggestion. If
you find it easy tc imagine your hands welded like two cold
blocks of steel, that is fine. But if you find this a
difficult situation to imagine, feel free to imagine anything
you like as long as it is consistent with the idea that you
cannot get your hands apart. Some people have found it useful
to imagine that their hands are glued together or bound
together by heavy string or chains.

When asked to try to pull ; sur hands apart, you can
reinforce your mental image by pressing down on your fingers
and pushing on your palms as your hands are clasped together
(demonstrate for subject). This way, you can actually make a
moderate physical effort to pull your hands apart, while
ensuring that they will not actually come apart. The pressure
of the pulling/pushing of the fingers and palms creates a
tension that easily reinforces a "can't pull apart" feeling.

Do not try too hard though, because you want it to seem that
61
this is not happening through any effort on your part. In
other words, you want it to seem as if you are trying, but
somehow just cannot get them apart. If you have ever tried to
move something impossibly heavy or stuck, you will know the
feeling of "can't do it" and be able to bring that feeling to
the hand lock suggestion. The innner dialogue should be along
these lines: "It's stuck", "I can't pull them apart", etc. .
Okay, I will play the suggestion now. By the way, you may put

your hands on your lap if you want.

THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE TAPE WITH THE SUGGESTION AND SCORES
ACCORDING TO OBJECTIVE “PASS” (1) (IF HANDS DID NOT COME
APART) CR "FAIL" (0) (IF HANDS DID COME APART). AFTER THE
SUGGESTION IS OVER, GIVE THE SUBJECT THE TWO QUESTIONS
PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE DURING THIS

SUGGESTION; SCORE THESE AS IN THE ARM RISING SUGGESTION.

Book Suggestion
PLAY THE INTRODUCTION ON THE AUDIOTAPE AND THEN AT “pay

careful attention" STOP IT AND TURN ON THE VIDEOTAPE FOR THE

RESPONSE AND THE INTERVIEW. STOP VIDEO

Discussion with the Subject

For this suggestion, it is important to embellish the
62
imagining with as many details as you can. First, pick a
Place on the table where you are going to imagine the book to
be. Once your eyes are open, just keep looking at that place
on the table. Of course, you will not see a real, concrete
book, but in your mind's eye you can trace the outline of
where the book would be if it was really there. Imagine what
angle it's on. Is it even with the edge of the table? off to
the side? And so forth. Imagine where you will be moving it
with your hand. Think about the size of the book, how much
space it would take up on the table, what colour it is, what
the title looks like and where it is on the book, is the book
paperback or hardcover? etc.

Have you got a desk at home or in the library where you
habitually study? If so maybe you would like to imagine that
you are sitting there studying and that you are going to
change to another topic, so you want to move this book to the
side.

Pick a book you know, something you are familiar with.
If you want, you can imagine that you brought it with you and
you have just placed it on the table, You may use a magazine,
if you wish. Also, some subjects have said that a simple
cover is best and they can "see" it more clearly than one with
a complex desing or colour scheme.

Make sure that you have the image firmly in your mind's
eye before you open your eyes. You may experience a slight

“jolt” or disconcerted feeling when you first open your eyes,

63

but just calmly continue to hold the image and "build" it on
the table in front of you. It is important that you involve
yourself with the suggestion, without distraction, for the
whole time. If the image fades or the concentration wanes,
just bring it back by working with one of the details of the
book. Like the other suggestions, this one involves a
physical movement, that of pushing the book aside. Even if
you are having difficulty imagining the book there, follow
through on the physical motion of pushing the book aside.
While you are doing this, imagine what the book would feel
like against your hand and how much pressure it would take to

push it aside.

HELPFUL HINTS: IF THE SUBJECT HAS TROUBLE WITH THIS
SUGGESTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SAY THEY CANNOT SEE THE BOOK,
TELL THEM THAT THIS SITUATION IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF
CHILDREN PLAYING HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD. THEY IMAGINE THAT THE
LAWN IS DIVIDED INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL
TAKE CARE TO WALK THROUGH THE DOORWAYS INSTEAD OF THE WALLS,
EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WOULD READILY ADMIT THAT THEY DON'T SEE
WALLS OR DOORWAYS OR ROOMS. SIMILARLY, HERE YOU WANT TO

BEHAVE AS IF THE BOOK YOU HAVE IN MIND IS REALLY THERE.

Now that you have a book in mind, sit back and relax. I

am going to play the suggestion now.
64
THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE SUGGESTION. THE SUBJECT PASSES THE
OBJECTIVE ITEM IF HE OR SHE PUSHES THEIR HAND ACROSS THE
TABLE. WITH PASSING THE SUBJCTIVE ITEMS, THE SUBJECT IS
ALLOWED TO GO ON TO THE NEXT SUGGESTION. IF THE SUBJECT NEEDS
A SECOND TRIAL, ASK: What book were you using? (maybe it's
too vague or complex). What difficulty did you experience?
Were you commenting on what you were doing? Were you able to

"see" the book first, clearly, in your mind's eye?

Amnesia Suggestion
THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE AUDIOTAPE FOR THE INTRODUCTION TO
THE SUGGESTION UNTIL IT SAYS: “Attend carefully to what she

does". THEN ROLL THE VIDEOTAPE FOR THE DEMONSTRATION AND

INTERVIEW WITH THE SUBJECT.

Discussion with the subjects

If you want, you can do what the subject on the tape did
and spend the whole time thinking of other things so that the
memories of the suggestions will not come to mind. If any of
them do pop into your thoughts, write it or them down right
away and continue to distract yourself so that the other
suggestions will not come back along with it.

If you find it difficult to disctract yourself, you might

want to try a different technique. You could try imagining
65
that you are in the type of situation where you know someone's
name but when it comes time to introduce that person, you
simply cannot remember it. Or you might imagine what it feels
like to be writing an exam and are unable to recall the answer
to a question you studied the night before. A good thing to
do in this case is to look at the blank piece of paper in
front of you and imagine your mind to be blank too. In fact,
some people only need to be confronted with a blank peice of
paper to feel that certain vague and unfocused feeling. Some
subjects find it useful to imagine that the suggestions are
written on a blackboard. When the suggestion to forget is
played, they then imagine that it is being erased. Any time
they feel an urge to recall the suggestions, they just imagine
that the balckboard is wiped clean and do not pursue the
matter any further. When the amnesia suggestion is cancelled,
they imagine the suggestions are being written on the board
again. Some peopie find that music is a powerful distraction.
Once they click into a song or a jingle, they are oblivious to
any other thoughts.

Some people are able to just let their minds wander and
need make little or no effort to distract themselves from
focusing on the suggestions. They have things to think about,
memories to contemplate, homework questions to consider, etc.
- Whatever techniques you decide to use, it is important that
you make believe that you are doing nothing to make the

suggestion go away, that it requires little effort. You want
66
it to feel like you are trying to remember them, but just
cannot. If your attention is on other things, it will feel as
if the suggestions have "gone away". Okay, I am going to play

the suggestion now. Sit back and relax.

THE EXPERIEMENTER PLAYS THE SUGGESTION AND PROVIDES BLANK
PAPERS TO THE SUBJECT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES, SCORES
OBJECTIVE RESPONDING. AFTER THE SUGGESTION IS OVER, THE
EXPERIMENTER GIVES THE SUBJECT THE SUBJECTIVE QUESTION.
REINFORCE THE SUBJECT'S RESPONDING. IF THE SUBJECT FAILS THE
SUGGESTION, FIND OUT WHAT THE DIFFICULTY IS AND MAKE

SUGGESTION FOR SUCCESSFUL RESPONDING.



The Test Suggestions

Okay, now I'm going to play the tape with four different
suggestions on it. They will be presented without any
discussion or dialogue between us. This is your chance to
utilize the skills you have developed today. The suggestions
will be introduced and there will only be enough time for you
to respond. Just follow along and attend carefully to the

suggestions. Afterwards, we will talk a bit more.

THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE AUDIOTAPE. IT HAS A _ SHORT
INTRODUCTION TO THE PROCEDURE FOR THESE NEW TEST SUGGESTIONS
AND THEN GOES RIGHT INTO THE FIRST ONE. THE EXPERIMENTER

PROVIDES PAPER FOR THE AMNESIA SUGGESTION. THE EXPERIMENTER

67
SCORES EACH ON THE OBJECTIVE MEASURE, AS IT IS HAPPENING. AT

THE END OF THE FOUR ITEM-TEST, THE EXPERIMENTER HANDS THE
SUBJECT THE SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONS. ONCE AGAIN, NO TALKING WITH
THE SUBJECT UNTIL HE OR SHE HAS COMPLETED ALL THE QUESTIONS.
WHEN THE SUBJECT HAS ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS, REINFORCE HIS
OR HER PARTICIPATION, IMPROVEMENT, ETC., THEN SAY: That is
the end of the session today. The skill you have practised
today may be utilized in other situations. As well, any time
you are called upon to respond to suggestions, you should use
the techniques that you have learned and worked wit here.

THE EXPERIMENTER SCHEDULES FOR THE NEXT SESSION THE POSTTEST

OF SUSCEPTIBILITY.
