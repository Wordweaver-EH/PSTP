**4. Research Questions:**
*   Primary: Does participation in the "Phenomenawork v2.01" class increase self-reported subjective responsiveness to standardized motor challenge suggestions delivered via text immediately following the class?
*   Secondary:
    *   Does participation influence expectancy regarding responsiveness to these suggestions?
    *   Does participation influence metacognitive confidence in expectancy and response ratings?
    *   Does participation influence surprise ratings associated with the response?
    *   How do qualitative descriptions of the experience change pre- vs. post-class?
    *   What is the prevalence and intensity of response to novel phenomena (Magnetic Hands, Lemon Taste, Happy, Phosphenes, Chills) introduced during the class?
    *   How does responsiveness to a motor challenge administered mid-class compare to pre- and post-class responsiveness?

**5. Hypotheses:**
*   **H1 (Primary):** Participants will report significantly higher subjective response ratings (0-5 scale) for both the "Arm Rigid" and "Arm Limp" suggestions on the post-class assessment (Act 3) compared to the pre-class assessment (Act 1). (Directional hypothesis: Increase expected).
*   **H2 (Secondary):** Participants will report significantly higher expectancy ratings (0-5 scale) for both suggestions on the post-class assessment compared to the pre-class assessment. (Directional hypothesis: Increase expected).
*   **H3 (Secondary):** Participants will report significantly higher confidence ratings (0-5 scale) in their response ratings on the post-class assessment compared to the pre-class assessment. (Directional hypothesis: Increase expected).
*   **H4 (Secondary, Exploratory):** Participants will report significantly higher confidence ratings (0-5 scale) in their expectancy ratings on the post-class assessment compared to the pre-class assessment.
*   **H5 (Secondary, Exploratory):** Surprise ratings (0-5 scale) associated with responses may change post-class compared to pre-class (direction unspecified, potentially decrease if expectancy aligns better with experience, or increase if effects become stronger than expected).
*   **H6 (Secondary, Exploratory):** Qualitative descriptions ("What was that like?") will show thematic shifts post-class, potentially indicating greater perceived involuntariness, vividness, ease, or acceptance of the experience.
*   **H7 (Secondary, Exploratory):** Responsiveness to the mid-intervention "Arm Stiff" suggestion (Act 2) may differ from pre- and post-class ratings, potentially influenced by the immediate class context and narrative.
*   **H8 (Secondary, Descriptive/Exploratory):** Data gathered during Act 2 will provide descriptive statistics on the distribution of responsiveness, expectancy, confidence, and surprise for Magnetic Hands, Lemon Taste, Happy, Phosphenes, and Chills phenomena within this participant group.

**6. Study Design:**
*   **Design:** Within-subject, pre-post intervention design.
*   **Intervention:** Participation in the live online "Phenomenawork v2.01" class, which includes educational content, mindset framing, and experiential exercises.
*   **Setting:** Online, conducted via Discord and Google Forms.

**7. Sampling Plan:**
*   **Population:** Self-selected attendees of the "Phenomenawork v2.01" class, likely drawn from an online community interested in hypnosis (e.g., Erotic Hypnosis Discord).
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** Participants who attend the class and complete *both* the pre-class (Act 1) and post-class (Act 3) Google Forms, providing a valid linking ID (Discord UserID or self-generated anonymous code).
*   **Exclusion Criteria for Analysis:**
    *   Primary analysis will include all participants meeting inclusion criteria.
    *   Secondary analyses *comparing pre-post change* may exclude participants who score the maximum possible rating (5/5) on a given primary response variable during the pre-test (Act 1) due to ceiling effects for that specific variable's change score. This will be reported.
    *   Participants reporting prior attendance at a "Phenomenawork" class will be included, but their status may be explored descriptively.
*   **Sample Size:** Determined by the number of eligible attendees who complete both forms (convenience sample). No formal power analysis was conducted; the study is considered exploratory regarding effect sizes.
*   **Stopping Rule:** Data collection for Act 1 closes before the class begins. Data collection for Act 3 opens immediately after the class and closes after a pre-determined window (e.g., 24 hours).

**8. Variables:**
*   **Independent Variable (Implicit):** Time point relative to intervention (Pre-class vs. Post-class).
*   **Primary Dependent Variables:** Subjective Response Ratings (0-5 scale) for "Arm Rigid" and "Arm Limp" suggestions (measured pre- and post-class).
*   **Secondary Dependent Variables / Process Measures:**
    *   Expectancy Ratings (0-5 scale) for "Arm Rigid" and "Arm Limp" (measured pre- and post-class).
    *   Confidence Ratings (0-5 scale) for Expectancy (measured pre- and post-class).
    *   Confidence Ratings (0-5 scale) for Response (measured pre- and post-class).
    *   Surprise Ratings (0-5 scale) for Response (measured pre- and post-class).
    *   Qualitative Descriptions ("What was that like?") for "Arm Rigid" and "Arm Limp" (collected pre- and post-class).
    *   Mid-Intervention "Arm Stiff" Response Rating (0-5 scale) (measured during Act 2).
    *   Ratings (Expectancy, Confidence, Response, Surprise) for "Magnetic Hands" and "Lemon Taste" (measured during Act 2).
    *   Ratings (Response, Confidence, Surprise) for "Happy," "Phosphenes," and "Chills" (measured during Act 2).
    *   Class Liking Rating (1-5 scale) and Qualitative Feedback (collected post-class).
    *   Prior Experience/Attendance data (collected pre-class).

**9. Procedure:**
1.  Participants complete the Pre-Class Google Form (Act 1) before the class begins. This includes demographics (prior attendance, ID), expectancy/confidence for motor challenges, and baseline measurement of response/confidence/surprise/qualitative experience for the two text-based motor challenges.
2.  Participants attend the live online "Phenomenawork v2.01" class.
3.  During the class, participants are prompted to fill sections of the Mid-Class Google Form (Act 2) immediately following specific demonstrations/exercises (Magnetic Hands, Lemon Taste, Woodweaver Redux components), providing expectancy, response, confidence, surprise, and/or qualitative data relevant to those exercises, including the mid-intervention arm stiffness measure.
4.  Immediately following the class, participants complete the Post-Class Google Form (Act 3). This includes class feedback, post-intervention expectancy/confidence for motor challenges, and post-intervention measurement of response/confidence/surprise/qualitative experience for the same two text-based motor challenges used in Act 1.

**10. Analysis Plan:**
*   **Data Preparation:** Responses from Act 1 and Act 3 will be linked using the provided UserID/anonymous code. Participants without matched pre/post data will be excluded from pre-post analyses.
*   **Primary Hypothesis (H1):** Paired-samples t-tests (or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests if normality assumptions are violated, assessed via Shapiro-Wilk test or visual inspection of histograms/Q-Q plots) will be used to compare mean pre-class vs. post-class subjective response ratings for "Arm Rigid" and "Arm Limp" separately. One-tailed tests will be used based on the directional hypothesis (increase).
*   **Secondary Hypotheses (H2, H3, H4, H5):** Similar paired-samples t-tests (or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) will be conducted for pre- vs. post-class comparisons of Expectancy, Confidence-in-Response, Confidence-in-Expectancy, and Surprise ratings. Two-tailed tests will be used for H5 (Surprise) due to the exploratory, non-directional hypothesis.
*   **Qualitative Data (H6):** Open-ended responses ("What was that like?") will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Pre- and post-class responses for each participant will be compared, looking for recurring themes related to perceived agency, vividness, difficulty, emotional tone, metaphors used, etc. Changes in theme frequency or content pre- vs. post-class will be described.
*   **Mid-Intervention Comparison (H7):** Descriptive statistics for the mid-intervention arm stiffness rating will be presented. Paired tests (t-test or Wilcoxon) may be used to compare mid-intervention ratings to pre- and post-class ratings, acknowledging the difference in context (live demo vs. text).
*   **Novel Phenomena (H8):** Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, frequency distributions) will be reported for expectancy, response, confidence, and surprise ratings for Magnetic Hands, Lemon Taste, Happy, Phosphenes, and Chills collected during Act 2.
*   **Correlations:** Exploratory correlational analyses (Pearson or Spearman, depending on data distribution) may be conducted to examine relationships between changes in expectancy, confidence, surprise, and response ratings.
*   **Subgroup Exploration:** If sample size permits, exploratory analyses may compare results between those with low vs. high pre-test scores, or those with/without prior class attendance.
*   **Handling of Effects:** Practice effects and demand characteristics are acknowledged as potential contributors to observed changes and are considered part of the phenomenon under investigation within this pragmatic, skills-training evaluation context, rather than confounds to be eliminated.
*   **Missing Data:** Participants missing primary outcome data for either pre- or post-test will be excluded from paired analyses. For secondary analyses or correlations, pairwise deletion may be used where appropriate.
*   **Outlier Handling:** No specific outlier removal plan is set a priori. Extreme or influential data points, if identified, will be investigated, and analyses may be reported both with and without them.
*   **Inference Criteria:** Alpha level set at p < .05. Effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d for t-tests, r for Wilcoxon) will be calculated and reported alongside p-values.
