-----------------------------------


Carleton Skills Training Program was developed by Spanos in the 1980s as a cognitive training intervention to increase hypnotic responsiveness.
The program took 75 minutes to administer.
It has been widely replicated, with studies showing it can significantly increase hypnotic responsiveness. Studies typically found that about half of low hypnotizable subjects became highly hypnotizable after going through the program. It consisted of three main components:

* Information: Providing educational content about hypnosis
* Modeling: Demonstrating hypnotic responses
* Instructions: Guiding participants through hypnotic techniques

This initiative, PSTP, aims to help cultivate phenomenal skills (phenomnelogical control skills, if you like more syllables) using those insights and others by treating "hypnotic" phenomena as skills. This requires us to have a basic understanding of factors underlying [skill acquisition](https://github.com/Wordweaver-EH/PSTP/blob/main/skillaqusitionreview.md).
