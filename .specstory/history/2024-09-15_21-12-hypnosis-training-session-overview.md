Here are the necessary edits to fix the transcript in `main.tw` using the information from `CSTP-transcripts.txt`:

```Twine/CSTP/source/main.tw
2| M: There it is. I can see it on the desk. It is an average-sized book, one like hundreds you've seen. It's right there in front of you on the desk.
4| H: (PAUSE) Open your eyes and look at the book sitting there on the desk. (WAIT 20 SECONDS) To avoid the book being in your way, why don't you just slide it off to the side. (WAIT 20 SECONDS)
8| H: The image of the book is now fading. It has faded completely and you can no longer see the book.
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Updated the description of the book to match the original transcript.
- Added the instruction to open the eyes and look at the book.
- Adjusted the fading statement to match the original wording.
