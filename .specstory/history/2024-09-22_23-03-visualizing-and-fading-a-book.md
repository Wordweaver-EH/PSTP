## Visualizing and Fading a Book (9/22/2024, 11:03:29 PM)

_**User**_

H: Place your hands on vour lap and close your eyes.
(PAUSE) I'm not sure if you have noticed, but there
is a book of mine of the desk in front of you. It's
an average size book, one like hundreds you've seen.
It's right there in front of you on the desk. Open
your eyes and look at the book sitting there on the

desk. (WAIT 20 SECONDS)

M: There it is. I can see it on the desk. I1 see the book

sitting there. It's kind of vague and fuzzy ... a

vague, coloured outline of the book; but it's there.

H: To avoid the book being in the way, why don't you just

slide it off to the side. (WAIT 20 SECONDS)

M: I'll just push it over there and get it out of the

way.

H: The image of the book is now fading. It's faded

completely and you no longer see the book.

It looks like you have two similar blocks of text for the book hallucination model. To avoid redundancy, you can remove one of them. Here is the updated file with the redundant block removed:

_**Assistant**_

Here are the differences between the two blocks of text:

1. **Typographical Errors and Formatting:**
   - The second block has a typo: "vour" instead of "your".
   - The second block has inconsistent formatting, such as "I1" instead of "I".
   - The second block has an extra line with "86" which seems out of place.

2. **Punctuation and Spacing:**
   - The first block uses consistent punctuation and spacing, while the second block has some inconsistencies.

3. **Content:**
   - The content is essentially the same, but the second block has minor variations in wording and formatting.

Here is a side-by-side comparison highlighting the differences:

### Summary of Differences:
1. **Typographical Errors:**
   - "vour" vs. "your"
   - "I1" vs. "I"
   - Extra line "86"

2. **Formatting:**
   - Inconsistent line breaks and spacing in the second block.

3. **Punctuation:**
   - The first block uses consistent punctuation, while the second block has some inconsistencies.

By keeping the first block and removing the second, you ensure the text is clean and free of errors.

Transcript of Interview between Model and Hypnotist

H: So, how did you find responding to this one?

M: It was really good. With practice, I got better and

better at it.

H: I see.

=

It's just like you said, it's like learning any skill

like swimming or math. It just takes coaching and
practice. And this skill, it's really important that

you use your imagination. You have to picture all the

make-believe events in your mind.

H: Like what?

M: Well, for instance, I just let myself imagine that my
arm was hollow. I could see it that way in my mind; you
know, I could see my hollow arm with the air hose

attache@ to it. I even imagined the pump. It was

ust like the air pumps that they have at gas stations.

I could see the pump and the hose coming from it and

pumping up my hollow arm.
M:

arm

felt

M:

B9

I see.

And there's another really important thing. You really
have to let yourself get into it. That really made the
difference like you said it would. Like, I didn't just
sit back and say, “Hey, I'm imagining all this".
Commenting on it would have just ruined the feeling. I
just let myself get totally engrossed imagining my
as hollow and being pumped up, and when I did, it all

like it was really happening.

So, it felt real.

That‘s right. That's the point of all this, isn't it?

You'tve got to make it feel real.

Yes, exactly.

There's a real knack to it. I found myself getting

better at it as I practiced.

H:

Very good.

Hand-lock Suggestion

H:

How was this one?
90
M: Good. I think I'm really getting good at the skill

now,

H: Yes, you sure are.

M: I just let myself feel everything that was
suggested. It really felt like my hands couldn't come

apart.

H: Anything else?

M: I just pictured that my hands were two heavy, cold
blocks of steel that were welded together. I got so

into these thoughts that they actually felt that way.

H: That's right.

M: If I'd stopped imagining and admitted to myself that
they could come apart, then sure, of course I could
have made them come apart, but that wasn't the point of
the suggestion. The point was to get involved in the
make-believe no matter what. So I just kept really
involved in imagining my hands were welded chunks of
steel. And I did this until the suggestion was completely

over.
H:

91
Very good. That's just what I wanted you to do.

Anything else?

Uh. No, can't think of anything.

Book Hallucination Suggestion

H:

M:

How did you find this one?

Well, before I was even asked to open my eyes, I had
everything pictured in my mind. Like, I pictured the
desk and I pictured the book on it. I pictured all

the details of how the book would be positioned on the
desk and how the book itself would look. I could see
the book near the edge of the desk and on the book I
could see the little call number sticker and the stamps

and everything.

And when you opened your eyes?

You know, it's funny. Opening my eyes didn't make much

of a difference.

How do you rean?

Well, everything I pictured when I had my _ eyes

closed, I let carry over to when I had my eyes open. I
92
didn't
let a thing change. I let myself see the book on the
exact spot when they were open as I had pictured it

when they were closed.

EK: I see what you mean. That's quite clever. Anything

else?

M: There's another thing. It's really important to
concentrate as deeply as possible. Like I know it's
important ‘:o concentrate on all the suggestions, but

it's especially important with this one. You can't
let your thoughts wander for a second. You really have

to let yourself see the book there all the time.

H: Uh hun.

M: There's a real knack to this. It's a skill just like

you said it was, but it's a strange one. It's a skill

at NOT noticing that you're really acting.

A stio

H: How was this one?

M: Pretty goodd. I just let my attention drift away from

the memories of the suggestion.
93

H: So it was YOU who caused the forgetting.

M: Sure, in a way. You can only remember things by sort fo
stopping what you're doing and letting yourself think back

to what you're supposed to remember.

H: Ah yes, I see.

M: I just didn't stop and let myself think back. Instead,

I just let my mind become preoccupied with other thir.

H: Like what?

M: For instance, I noticed that my feet felt heavy and
tingling, and so I just concentrated on theses
sensations in my feet. As long as I did that, and
didn't shift my attention back to what I was supposed

to remember, then I really couldn't remember.

H: Yes, I see. What about when you were told to try and

remember the suggestions?

M: Well, it's like with the other suggestions ... you
know, when I was asked to try to separate my hands. I

didn't stop thinking oi my hands as stuck and welded
94

together. For the suggestion to forget, I just kept on
distracting myself. The point of the suggestion was to
keep up the forgetting no matter what, so that's what I
did.

Yes, that's right. Anything else?

No ... well except that, like I said before, there's a
real knack to this. You can really get good at it once
you practice. You can really feel yourself getting
better at controlling your mind to do all these things.

Almost everyone finds that.

Like, you can actually turn the make-believe into

reality ... and get good at it! It's actually kind of

H:

fun!

You know, almost everyone finds tha‘ too.

This way, the interview transcript is integrated into the flow of the story, providing additional context and depth to the suggestions.

---

_**User**_

in @CSTP-transcripts.txt when would this actually play in the experiment

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the content of the CSTP-transcripts.txt file, this transcript appears to be part of the training materials used in the experiment. It would likely be played or presented to participants at specific points during the training session. Here's a breakdown of when different parts might be used:

1. The "Modification Instructions" (lines 1-58) would likely be read or presented to participants at the beginning of the training session to explain the procedure.

2. The transcripts of the model's responses to various suggestions (starting from line 922) would be played as video demonstrations after each suggestion is introduced. This is indicated by lines such as "PLAY VIDEOTAPE OF MODEL" throughout the document.

3. The audio training information (starting from line 418) would probably be played or read to participants early in the session to provide background on hypnosis and dispel common myths.

4. The instructions for each suggestion (e.g., arm rising, hand lock, book hallucination, amnesia) would be presented before each corresponding video demonstration.

5. The "Test Suggestions" instructions (starting from line 805) would be given near the end of the training session, before the final set of suggestions that participants respond to without further coaching.

In the context of the Twine story structure you've been working on, these transcripts would inform the content of various passages, particularly the instructional and demonstrational parts before each suggestion is attempted by the participant.

---

_**User**_

I meant the interviews

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're right to focus on the interviews. Based on the structure of the transcript and the experiment flow, the interviews would likely be played at specific points in the experiment:

1. After each suggestion demonstration and before the participant tries it themselves. 

2. The interviews serve as additional instruction and modeling, providing insight into the thought processes and techniques used by a successful responder.

In the context of your Twine story structure, you could integrate these interviews as follows:

1. After the video demonstration of each suggestion (Arm Rising, Hand Lock, Book Hallucination, Amnesia)
2. Before the participant attempts each suggestion themselves

For example:

```twine
:: Arm_Rising_Model
(PLAY VIDEOTAPE OF MODEL)
... [model demonstration content] ...

[[Continue|Arm_Rising_Interview]]

:: Arm_Rising_Interview
[Insert interview transcript for Arm Rising here]

[[Continue|Arm_Rising]]

:: Arm_Rising
[Participant attempts Arm Rising suggestion]
```

This structure would allow the participant to see the demonstration, hear the model's thought process and techniques through the interview, and then attempt the suggestion themselves. This approach provides multiple layers of instruction and modeling before each practice attempt.

---

_**User**_

does it say that somewhere

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right to ask for specific evidence. After reviewing the transcript more carefully, I don't see an explicit statement about when exactly these interviews would be played. I apologize for my previous assumption.

However, there are some hints in the text that suggest the general structure:

1. From the "Modification Instructions" section:

```
Following this, you will see a short interview during which the major points will be clarified. Pay close attention to these points.

Then you will have an opportunity to practice responding to the suggestion yourself.
```

This implies that the interview comes after the demonstration but before the participant's attempt.

2. The interviews themselves are structured as discussions about how the model responded to each suggestion, which logically would come after the demonstration of that suggestion.

Given this information, the most likely placement of these interviews would be:

1. After the video demonstration of each suggestion
2. Before the participant attempts each suggestion themselves

However, you're correct to point out that the exact timing isn't explicitly stated in the transcript. If you need to be certain about the placement, it might be best to either make an educated guess based on the available information or to seek clarification from additional sources if available.

_**User**_

@CSTP-transcripts.txt has a part where it goes: Ask what mental image the subject used, and perhaps suggest an elaboration or a different one. 

How can we incorporate it in the twine story

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, that's a good point to incorporate into the Twine story. We can add this as an optional interaction after each suggestion attempt. Here's how we could modify the structure:

```twine
:: Arm_Rising
<<set $arm_rising_attempts to 0>>
// ... existing content ...

[[Your arm rises at least six inches|Arm_Rising_Score]]
[[Your arm rises less than six inches|Arm_Rising_Troubleshooting]]

:: Arm_Rising_Score
<<set $arm_rising_score to $arm_rising_score + 1>>
<<set $arm_rising_subjective to 0>>
What mental image did you use for the arm rising suggestion?

[[I imagined my arm as a balloon filled with helium|Arm_Rising_Image_Feedback]]
[[I imagined balloons tied to my arm|Arm_Rising_Image_Feedback]]
[[I imagined a pulley system lifting my arm|Arm_Rising_Image_Feedback]]
[[I used a different mental image|Arm_Rising_Image_Custom]]

:: Arm_Rising_Image_Feedback
That's a great image to use. You might also try imagining your arm as extremely light, like a feather, or imagine a warm updraft of air gently lifting your arm.

How would you rate your experience of the arm rising suggestion?

[[It felt completely real and involuntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_A]]
[[It felt somewhat real and involuntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_B]]
[[It felt somewhat voluntary but I was surprised by how real it felt|Arm_Rising_Subjective_C]]
[[It felt completely voluntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_D]]

:: Arm_Rising_Image_Custom
What mental image did you use? [Type your answer here]

That's an interesting approach. You might also try imagining your arm as a balloon filled with helium, or imagine balloons tied to your arm gently pulling it upward.

How would you rate your experience of the arm rising suggestion?

[[It felt completely real and involuntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_A]]
[[It felt somewhat real and involuntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_B]]
[[It felt somewhat voluntary but I was surprised by how real it felt|Arm_Rising_Subjective_C]]
[[It felt completely voluntary|Arm_Rising_Subjective_D]]

// ... rest of the content ...
```

This structure:

1. Asks the participant what mental image they used after each successful suggestion attempt.
2. Provides feedback on their chosen image and suggests alternatives or elaborations.
3. Still collects the subjective experience rating.

You can replicate this structure for each of the suggestions (Hand Lock, Book Hallucination, Amnesia) with appropriate variations in the mental images suggested.

This approach incorporates the instruction from the transcript to ask about the mental image used and suggest elaborations or alternatives, while maintaining the flow of the Twine story and the collection of scores and subjective experiences.

_**User**_

no, I think that's fubar. we should be having things directly from the study:


For this suggestion, it is important to embellish the
62
imagining with as many details as you can. First, pick a
Place on the table where you are going to imagine the book to
be. Once your eyes are open, just keep looking at that place
on the table. Of course, you will not see a real, concrete
book, but in your mind's eye you can trace the outline of
where the book would be if it was really there. Imagine what
angle it's on. Is it even with the edge of the table? off to
the side? And so forth. Imagine where you will be moving it
with your hand. Think about the size of the book, how much
space it would take up on the table, what colour it is, what
the title looks like and where it is on the book, is the book
paperback or hardcover? etc.

Have you got a desk at home or in the library where you
habitually study? If so maybe you would like to imagine that
you are sitting there studying and that you are going to
change to another topic, so you want to move this book to the
side.

Pick a book you know, something you are familiar with.
If you want, you can imagine that you brought it with you and
you have just placed it on the table, You may use a magazine,
if you wish. Also, some subjects have said that a simple
cover is best and they can "see" it more clearly than one with
a complex desing or colour scheme.

Make sure that you have the image firmly in your mind's
eye before you open your eyes. You may experience a slight

“jolt” or disconcerted feeling when you first open your eyes,

63

but just calmly continue to hold the image and "build" it on
the table in front of you. It is important that you involve
yourself with the suggestion, without distraction, for the
whole time. If the image fades or the concentration wanes,
just bring it back by working with one of the details of the
book. Like the other suggestions, this one involves a
physical movement, that of pushing the book aside. Even if
you are having difficulty imagining the book there, follow
through on the physical motion of pushing the book aside.
While you are doing this, imagine what the book would feel
like against your hand and how much pressure it would take to

push it aside.

HELPFUL HINTS: IF THE SUBJECT HAS TROUBLE WITH THIS
SUGGESTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SAY THEY CANNOT SEE THE BOOK,
TELL THEM THAT THIS SITUATION IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF
CHILDREN PLAYING HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD. THEY IMAGINE THAT THE
LAWN IS DIVIDED INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL
TAKE CARE TO WALK THROUGH THE DOORWAYS INSTEAD OF THE WALLS,
EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WOULD READILY ADMIT THAT THEY DON'T SEE
WALLS OR DOORWAYS OR ROOMS. SIMILARLY, HERE YOU WANT TO

BEHAVE AS IF THE BOOK YOU HAVE IN MIND IS REALLY THERE.

Now that you have a book in mind, sit back and relax. I

am going to play the suggestion now.
64
THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE SUGGESTION. THE SUBJECT PASSES THE
OBJECTIVE ITEM IF HE OR SHE PUSHES THEIR HAND ACROSS THE
TABLE. WITH PASSING THE SUBJCTIVE ITEMS, THE SUBJECT IS
ALLOWED TO GO ON TO THE NEXT SUGGESTION. IF THE SUBJECT NEEDS
A SECOND TRIAL, ASK: What book were you using? (maybe it's
too vague or complex). What difficulty did you experience?
Were you commenting on what you were doing? Were you able to

"see" the book first, clearly, in your mind's eye?

Amnesia Suggestion
THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE AUDIOTAPE FOR THE INTRODUCTION TO
THE SUGGESTION UNTIL IT SAYS: “Attend carefully to what she

does". THEN ROLL THE VIDEOTAPE FOR THE DEMONSTRATION AND

INTERVIEW WITH THE SUBJECT.

Discussion with the subjects

If you want, you can do what the subject on the tape did
and spend the whole time thinking of other things so that the
memories of the suggestions will not come to mind. If any of
them do pop into your thoughts, write it or them down right
away and continue to distract yourself so that the other
suggestions will not come back along with it.

If you find it difficult to disctract yourself, you might

want to try a different technique. You could try imagining
65
that you are in the type of situation where you know someone's
name but when it comes time to introduce that person, you
simply cannot remember it. Or you might imagine what it feels
like to be writing an exam and are unable to recall the answer
to a question you studied the night before. A good thing to
do in this case is to look at the blank piece of paper in
front of you and imagine your mind to be blank too. In fact,
some people only need to be confronted with a blank peice of
paper to feel that certain vague and unfocused feeling. Some
subjects find it useful to imagine that the suggestions are
written on a blackboard. When the suggestion to forget is
played, they then imagine that it is being erased. Any time
they feel an urge to recall the suggestions, they just imagine
that the balckboard is wiped clean and do not pursue the
matter any further. When the amnesia suggestion is cancelled,
they imagine the suggestions are being written on the board
again. Some peopie find that music is a powerful distraction.
Once they click into a song or a jingle, they are oblivious to
any other thoughts.

Some people are able to just let their minds wander and
need make little or no effort to distract themselves from
focusing on the suggestions. They have things to think about,
memories to contemplate, homework questions to consider, etc.
- Whatever techniques you decide to use, it is important that
you make believe that you are doing nothing to make the

suggestion go away, that it requires little effort. You want
66
it to feel like you are trying to remember them, but just
cannot. If your attention is on other things, it will feel as
if the suggestions have "gone away". Okay, I am going to play

the suggestion now. Sit back and relax.

THE EXPERIEMENTER PLAYS THE SUGGESTION AND PROVIDES BLANK
PAPERS TO THE SUBJECT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES, SCORES
OBJECTIVE RESPONDING. AFTER THE SUGGESTION IS OVER, THE
EXPERIMENTER GIVES THE SUBJECT THE SUBJECTIVE QUESTION.
REINFORCE THE SUBJECT'S RESPONDING. IF THE SUBJECT FAILS THE
SUGGESTION, FIND OUT WHAT THE DIFFICULTY IS AND MAKE

SUGGESTION FOR SUCCESSFUL RESPONDING.

The Test Suggestions

Okay, now I'm going to play the tape with four different
suggestions on it. They will be presented without any
discussion or dialogue between us. This is your chance to
utilize the skills you have developed today. The suggestions
will be introduced and there will only be enough time for you
to respond. Just follow along and attend carefully to the

suggestions. Afterwards, we will talk a bit more.

THE EXPERIMENTER PLAYS THE AUDIOTAPE. IT HAS A _ SHORT
INTRODUCTION TO THE PROCEDURE FOR THESE NEW TEST SUGGESTIONS
AND THEN GOES RIGHT INTO THE FIRST ONE. THE EXPERIMENTER

PROVIDES PAPER FOR THE AMNESIA SUGGESTION. THE EXPERIMENTER

67
SCORES EACH ON THE OBJECTIVE MEASURE, AS IT IS HAPPENING. AT

THE END OF THE FOUR ITEM-TEST, THE EXPERIMENTER HANDS THE
SUBJECT THE SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONS. ONCE AGAIN, NO TALKING WITH
THE SUBJECT UNTIL HE OR SHE HAS COMPLETED ALL THE QUESTIONS.
WHEN THE SUBJECT HAS ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS, REINFORCE HIS
OR HER PARTICIPATION, IMPROVEMENT, ETC., THEN SAY: That is
the end of the session today. The skill you have practised
today may be utilized in other situations. As well, any time
you are called upon to respond to suggestions, you should use
the techniques that you have learned and worked wit here.

THE EXPERIMENTER SCHEDULES FOR THE NEXT SESSION THE POSTTEST

OF SUSCEPTIBILITY.

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my previous suggestion that deviated from the study's protocol. Let's incorporate the actual instructions from the study into the Twine story structure. Here's how we could do it for the Book Hallucination suggestion:

```twine
:: Book_Hallucination_Pref
For this suggestion, it's important to embellish your imagining with as many details as you can. First, pick a place on the table where you're going to imagine the book to be. Once your eyes are open, just keep looking at that place on the table. 

Of course, you won't see a real, concrete book, but in your mind's eye you can trace the outline of where the book would be if it was really there. Imagine:
- What angle it's on
- Is it even with the edge of the table? Off to the side?
- Where you will be moving it with your hand
- The size of the book
- How much space it would take up on the table
- What color it is
- What the title looks like and where it is on the book
- Is the book paperback or hardcover?

[[Continue|Book_Hallucination_Pref2]]

:: Book_Hallucination_Pref2
Have you got a desk at home or in the library where you habitually study? If so, maybe you'd like to imagine that you are sitting there studying and that you are going to change to another topic, so you want to move this book to the side.

Pick a book you know, something you are familiar with. If you want, you can imagine that you brought it with you and you have just placed it on the table. You may use a magazine, if you wish. Also, some subjects have said that a simple cover is best and they can "see" it more clearly than one with a complex design or color scheme.

[[Continue|Book_Hallucination_Pref3]]

:: Book_Hallucination_Pref3
Make sure that you have the image firmly in your mind's eye before you open your eyes. You may experience a slight "jolt" or disconcerted feeling when you first open your eyes, but just calmly continue to hold the image and "build" it on the table in front of you. 

It's important that you involve yourself with the suggestion, without distraction, for the whole time. If the image fades or the concentration wanes, just bring it back by working with one of the details of the book. 

Like the other suggestions, this one involves a physical movement, that of pushing the book aside. Even if you are having difficulty imagining the book there, follow through on the physical motion of pushing the book aside. While you are doing this, imagine what the book would feel like against your hand and how much pressure it would take to push it aside.

What book were you using? (Maybe it's too vague or complex)
What difficulty did you experience?
Were you commenting on what you were doing?
Were you able to "see" the book first, clearly, in your mind's eye?

Remember, this situation is somewhat like that of children playing house in the backyard. They imagine that the lawn is divided into different rooms of the house and they all take care to walk through the doorways instead of the walls, even though everyone would readily admit that they don't see walls or doorways or rooms. Similarly, here you want to behave as if the book you have in mind is really there.

You're right, I apologize for altering the wording. Let's use the exact text from the study for the Book Hallucination suggestion:

```twine

For this suggestion, it is important to embellish the imagining with as many details as you can. First, pick a place on the table where you are going to imagine the book to be. Once your eyes are open, just keep looking at that place on the table. Of course, you will not see a real, concrete book, but in your mind's eye you can trace the outline of where the book would be if it was really there. Imagine what angle it's on. Is it even with the edge of the table? off to the side? And so forth. Imagine where you will be moving it with your hand. Think about the size of the book, how much space it would take up on the table, what colour it is, what the title looks like and where it is on the book, is the book paperback or hardcover? etc.

HELPFUL HINTS: IF THE SUBJECT HAS TROUBLE WITH THIS SUGGESTION, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SAY THEY CANNOT SEE THE BOOK, TELL THEM THAT THIS SITUATION IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF CHILDREN PLAYING HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD. THEY IMAGINE THAT THE LAWN IS DIVIDED INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL TAKE CARE TO WALK THROUGH THE DOORWAYS INSTEAD OF THE WALLS, EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WOULD READILY ADMIT THAT THEY DON'T SEE WALLS OR DOORWAYS OR ROOMS. SIMILARLY, HERE YOU WANT TO BEHAVE AS IF THE BOOK YOU HAVE IN MIND IS REALLY THERE.

This structure maintains the exact wording from the study while fitting it into the Twine story format. The experimenter's instructions are included as written, and the flow of the suggestion follows the study's protocol.
